# Nashville Housing Analysis using SQL

## Project Overview

Welcome to my Nashville Housing Analysis project, where I leveraged the power of SQL to uncover insights and trends in the Nashville housing market! I began by importing the Nashville housing dataset from Excel into SQL, and then performed various queries to explore and analyze the data.

Dataset: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nT_izOz1MY-FImyGXNbziJYab0nFUKej/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105856564783983052833&rtpof=true&sd=true

The dataset used in this project is the Nashville Housing table, containing information on:

- Property characteristics
- Sales data (e.g., price, date)
- Location (e.g., neighborhood, zip code)

## SQL Analysis

Using SQL, I performed various queries to:

- Explore the distribution of property types and sizes
- Analyze the relationship between property age and sales price
- Identify trends in sales activity by neighborhood and time of year
